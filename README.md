# What is this repository?
This repository includes a folder and article.html file for students in a web design ato fork and fix. 

The content of the article, is from the Conversation, a blog put out by academics under Creative Commons licenses - non-derivative. The license lends itself to this kind of work because we are free to republish the work from the articles in any format. 

**It is very important that you do not change the actual article content! This will break the copyright license agreement.** See [the Conversation republishing guideline webpag](https://theconversation.com/us/republishing-guidelines)e for more information. 

Students will fork this error-conversation-article branch, fix the article by using the validator tool and add semantic elements to the article. This is a practice in only marking up the article without changing any of the content, a common practice for web designers and developers. 

After redesigning the page so that it is a standalone webpage, which means including the skeleton code, students will run the code through a web validator tool online. They will compare it to the Visual Studio Code extension. 

The instructor intentionally messed up some of the code so there are definitely errors to fix!

We are using the lesson from the HTML reference, [Semantic Elements](https://htmlandcssguidebook.com/html/html5-semantic/), in the HTML & CSS Guidebook, by Josiah Spence. The _semantic elements_ that should be used for this article include: 

- header
- main
- footer
- article
- figure and figcaption

It will be very important to pay attention to what the kind of content is included so we know what elements to use for the article. You will only have one main and one article, but you may find it useful to use multiple headers considering the format of the article. You also may find it useful to have multiple footers, one inside the article element and one outside of it before the closing body tag. What information would be outside of the article but in a footer you may ask? How about the information about who coded the page (that's you!).

# Learning Objectives
Upon the successful completion of this project, students will be able to use semantic HTML elements in order to give a web page meaning. They will be able to use an HTML validator service and fix errors in their code based on web standards.
